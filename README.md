    Genetic Artist

<h4 align="center">
    Automagically redraw any image into a painting by means of artificial evolution.
</h4>

## Disclaimer
The idea comes from https://github.com/Tikitikitikidesuka/GeneticArtist but I found it via https://github.com/ahmedfgad/GeneticArtist. 
I just took it as a challenge to recreate in c# and try to make it run faster.

##  Key Features

* **Recreate any image through genetic algorithms**: _Genetic Artist_ uses genetic algorithms to recreate images by painting brushstrokes, resulting in unique and stunning artwork.
* **Watch the creative process in action**: Allows you to watch the artist at work and see the progress brushstroke by brushstroke.
* **Self adapting**: The population count and number of generation starts very low (2) but will increase by itself if the algorithm fails to find solution that improves the painting.
* **Free and open-source!**: Every part of the _Genetic Artist_ is accessible for you to experiment and tinker with. Don't be shy and contribute all you want!

## How to Use

Just build _GeneticArtist.App_ and run.
